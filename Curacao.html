                <h3> "Curacao - surprise destination in Caribe" </h3>
                    <p> from Vermonter5744 in Vermont </p>
                        <blockquote> We ended up in Curacao because of a time share trade. I'm so glad we went there. The island is unique - 97% literacy, multi-lingual residents, varies economy which doesn't just depend on tourism. The experience has stuck with me. The landscape is varied from desert to tropical paradise. We snorkeled 1-2 different sites every day. The snorkeling was very good but watch out for the currents which carry you along un-noticed until you turn around to go back. The drop off is close to shore and quite sudden. The city, the floating bridge, and the pretty painted buildings were worth a day trip. In addition to snorkeling we took a trip to Janchi's for lunch and a trip to the north side of the island to the desert landscape. </blockquote>

                <h3> "Aqualife: Spanish Water Resort Gem" </h3>
                    <p> from Dutch68 in the Netherlands </p>
                        <blockquote> Aqualife apartments are loctaed on the best spot of Curacao. There is a swimming pool and direct acces to a private beach. Fishing is great right in front of the door. The apartments are clean and comfortable with satelite TV and high speed internet. My family enjoyed snorkling in font of the house and catching snappers at night. At the same time it is only 15 minutes away from Willemstad, the main city in Curacao. If peace and quiet is what you want, this is the place to be. </blockquote>
